# Use Pre\-built SageMaker Docker images<a name="docker-containers-prebuilt"></a>

Amazon SageMaker provides containers for its built\-in algorithms and pre\-built Docker images for some of the most common machine learning frameworks, such as Apache MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Chainer\. It also supports machine learning libraries such as scikit\-learn and SparkML\. 

You can use these images from your SageMaker notebook instance or SageMaker Studio\. You can also extend the pre\-built SageMaker images to include libraries and needed functionality\. The following topics give information about the available images and how to use them\.

**Note**  
For information on Docker images for developing reinforcement learning \(RL\) solutions in SageMaker, see [SageMaker RL Containers](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-rl-container)\.
