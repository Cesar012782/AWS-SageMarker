# View a model lineage graph<a name="model-dashboard-lineage"></a>

When you train a model, Amazon SageMaker creates a visualization of your entire ML workflow from data preparation to deployment\. This visualization is called a model lineage graph and uses entities to represent individual steps in your workflow\. For example, a basic model lineage graph might have an entity representing your training set, which is associated with an entity representing your training job, which is associated with another entity representing your model\.

In addition, the graph stores information about each step in your workflow\. With this information, you can recreate any step in the workflow or track model and dataset lineage\. For example, SageMaker Lineage stores the S3 URI of your input data sources with each job so you can perform further analysis of the data sources for compliance verification\.

While the model lineage graph can help you view the steps in individual workflows, there are many other capabilities that you can leverage using the AWS SDK\. For example, with the AWS SDK you can create or query your entities\. For more information about the full set of features in SageMaker Lineage and example notebooks, see [Amazon SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking](lineage-tracking.md)\.
