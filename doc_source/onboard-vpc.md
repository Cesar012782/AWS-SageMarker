# Choose an Amazon VPC<a name="onboard-vpc"></a>

This topic provides detailed information about choosing an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) when you onboard to Amazon SageMaker Domain\. For more information about onboarding to SageMaker Domain, see [Onboard to Amazon SageMaker Domain](gs-studio-onboard.md)\.

By default, SageMaker Domain uses two Amazon VPC\. One Amazon VPC is managed by Amazon SageMaker and provides direct internet access\. You specify the other Amazon VPC, which provides encrypted traffic between the Domain and your Amazon Elastic File System \(Amazon EFS\) volume\.

You can change this behavior so that SageMaker sends all traffic over your specified Amazon VPC\. When you choose this option, you must provide the subnets, security groups, and interface endpoints that are necessary to communicate with the SageMaker API and SageMaker runtime, and various AWS services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) and Amazon CloudWatch, that are used by Amazon SageMaker Studio and your Studio notebooks\.

When you onboard to SageMaker Domain, you tell SageMaker to send all traffic over your Amazon VPC by setting the network access type to **VPC only**\.

**To specify the Amazon VPC information**

When you specify the Amazon VPC entities \(that is, the Amazon VPC, subnet, or security group\) in the following procedure, one of three options is presented based on the number of entities you have in the current AWS Region\. The behavior is as follows:
+ One entity – SageMaker uses that entity\. This can't be changed\.
+ Multiple entities – You must choose the entities from the dropdown list\.
+ No entities – You must create one or more entities in order to use Domain\. Choose **Create <entity>** to open the VPC console in a new browser tab\. After you create the entities, return to the Domain **Get started** page to continue the onboarding process\.

This procedure is part of the Amazon SageMaker Domain onboarding process when you choose **Standard setup**\. Your Amazon VPC information is specified under the **Network** section\.

1. Choose the Amazon VPC\.

1. Choose one or more subnets\. If you don't choose any subnets, SageMaker uses all the subnets in the Amazon VPC\. We recommend that you use multiple subnets that are not created in constrained Availability Zones\. Using subnets in these constrained Availability Zones can result in insufficient capacity errors and longer application creation times\. For more information about constrained Availability Zones, see [Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-availability-zones)\.

1. Select the network access type\. 
**Note**  
If **VPC only** is selected, SageMaker automatically applies the security group settings defined for the Domain to all shared spaces created in the Domain\. If **Public internet only** is selected, SageMaker does not apply the security group settings to shared spaces created in the Domain\.
   + **Public internet only** – Non\-Amazon EFS traffic goes through a SageMaker managed Amazon VPC, which allows internet access\. Traffic between the Domain and your Amazon EFS volume is through the specified Amazon VPC\.
   + **VPC only** – All SageMaker traffic is through the specified Amazon VPC and subnets\. You must use a subnet that does not have direct internet access in **VPC only** mode\. Internet access is disabled by default\.

1. Choose the security groups\. If you chose **Public internet only**, this step is optional\. If you chose **VPC only**, this step is required\.
**Note**  
For the maximum number of allowed security groups, see [UserSettings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UserSettings.html)\.
