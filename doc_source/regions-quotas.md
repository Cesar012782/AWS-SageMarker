For a list of SageMaker quotas, see [Amazon SageMaker endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sagemaker.html#limits_sagemaker) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

The [ Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/sagemaker/quotas) provides information about your service quotas\. You can use the Service Quotas console to view your default service quotas or to request quota increases\. To request a quota increase for adjustable quotas, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html)\.

You can set up a quota request template for your AWS Organization that automatically requests quota increases during account creation\. For more information, see [Using Service Quotas request templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/organization-templates.html)\.
