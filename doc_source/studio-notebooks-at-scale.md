# Prepare Data at Scale with Studio Notebooks<a name="studio-notebooks-at-scale"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Studio gives data scientists, machine learning \(ML\) engineers, and general practitioners tools to perform data analytics and data preparation at scale\. Analyzing, transforming, and preparing large amounts of data is a foundational step of any data science and ML workflow\. SageMaker Studio comes with built\-in integration of Amazon EMR and AWS Glue Interactive Sessions to handle your large\-scale interactive data preparation and machine learning workflows, all within your Studio notebook\.

Amazon EMR is a managed big data platform with resources to help you run petabyte\-scale distributed data processing jobs using open\-source analytics frameworks on AWS such as [Apache Spark](http://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/spark), [Apache Hive](http://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/hive), [Presto](http://aws.amazon.com/emr/features/presto), HBase, Flink, and Hudi among others\. Data engineers and data scientists use Amazon EMR for a wide variety of use cases, including big data analytics, what\-if analyses, real time analytics, and data preparation for machine learning\. Studio integration with Amazon EMR allows you to easily create, browse, discover, and connect to EMR clusters without leaving your Studio notebook\. You can even monitor and debug your Spark workloads with one\-click access to the Spark UI from within the notebook\. You should consider EMR for your data preparation workloads if you want maximum control over hardware and software versions, containers, and big data processing applications\.

AWS Glue Interactive Sessions is a serverless service that you can enlist to collect, transform, cleanse, and prepare data for storage in your data lakes and data pipelines\. Glue Interactive Sessions provides an on\-demand, serverless Apache Spark runtime environment that you can initialize in seconds on a dedicated Data Processing Unit \(DPU\) without having to worry about provisioning and managing complex compute cluster infrastructure\. After initialization, you can quickly browse the Glue data catalog, run large queries, access data governed by AWS Lake Formation, and interactively analyze and prepare data using Spark, right in your Studio notebook\. You can then use the prepared data to build, train, tune and deploy models using the purpose\-built ML tools within SageMaker Studio\. You should consider Glue Interactive Sessions for your data preparation workloads when you want a serverless Spark service with moderate control of configurability and flexibility\.
