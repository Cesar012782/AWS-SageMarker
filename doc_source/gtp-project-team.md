# Create a Project Team<a name="gtp-project-team"></a>

A project team provides access to the members from your organization or team to track projects, view metrics, and review annotations\. You can create a SageMaker Ground Truth Plus project team once you have shared your data in an Amazon S3 bucket\.

To add team members using Amazon Cognito, you have two options:

1. Create a new Amazon Cognito user group

   1. Enter an **Amazon Cognito user group name**\. This name cannot be changed\.

   1. Enter the email addresses of up to 50 team members in the **Email addresses** field\. The addresses must be separated by a comma\.

   1. Choose **Create project team**\.

1. Import team members from existing Amazon Cognito user groups\.

   1. Choose a user pool that you have created\. User pools require a domain and an existing user group\. If you get an error that the domain is missing, set it in the **Domain name** options on the **App integration** page of the Amazon Cognito console for your group\.

   1. Choose an app client\. We recommend using a client generated by Amazon SageMaker\.

   1. Choose a user group from your pool to import its members\.

   1. Choose **Create project team**\.

You can view and manage the list of team members through the AWS console\.

**To add team members after creating the project team:**

1. Choose **Invite new members** in the **Members** section\.

1. Enter the email addresses of up to 50 team members in the **Email addresses** field\. The addresses must be separated by a comma\.

1. Choose **Invite new members**

**To delete existing team members:**

1. Choose the team member to be deleted in the **Members** section\.

1. Choose **Delete**\.

Once you have added members to your project team, you can open the project portal to access your projects\.
