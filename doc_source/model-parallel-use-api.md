# Run a SageMaker Distributed Training Job with Model Parallelism<a name="model-parallel-use-api"></a>

Learn how to run a model parallel training job using the SageMaker Python SDK with your own training script and SageMaker's model parallelism library\.

There are three use\-case scenarios for running a SageMaker training job:

1. You can use one of the pre\-built AWS Deep Learning Container for TensorFlow and PyTorch\. This option is recommended if it is the first time for you to use the model parallel library\. To find a tutorial for how to run a SageMaker model parallel training job, see the example notebooks at [PyTorch training with Amazon SageMaker's model parallelism library](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/main/training/distributed_training/pytorch/model_parallel)\.

1. You can extend the pre\-built containers to handle any additional functional requirements for your algorithm or model that the pre\-built SageMaker Docker image doesn't support\. To find an example of how you can extend a pre\-built container, see [Extend a Pre\-built Container](prebuilt-containers-extend.md)\.

1. You can adapt your own Docker container to work with SageMaker using the [SageMaker Training toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-training-toolkit)\. For an example, see [Adapting Your Own Training Container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/adapt-training-container.html)\.

For options 2 and 3 in the preceding list, refer to [Extend a Pre\-built Docker Container that Contains SageMaker's Distributed Model Parallel Library](model-parallel-sm-sdk.md#model-parallel-customize-container) to learn how to install the model parallel library in an extended or customized Docker container\. 

In all cases, you launch your training job configuring a SageMaker `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` estimator to initialize the library\. To learn more, see the following topics\.
