# Describe a serverless endpoint<a name="serverless-endpoints-describe"></a>

You might want to retrieve information about your endpoint, including details such as the endpointâ€™s ARN, current status, deployment configuration, and failure reasons\. You can find information about your endpoint using the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home), the [DescribeEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEndpoint.html) API, or the AWS CLI\.

## To describe an endpoint \(using API\)<a name="serverless-endpoints-describe-api"></a>

For `EndpointName`, use the name of the endpoint you want to check\.

```
response = client.describe_endpoint(
    EndpointName="<your-endpoint-name>",
)
```
