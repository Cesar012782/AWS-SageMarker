# Sample Notebooks<a name="clarify-post-training-bias-model-explainability-sample-notebooks"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Clarify provides the following sample notebooks for post\-training bias detection and model explainability:
+ [Fairness and Explainability with SageMaker Clarify](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-clarify/fairness_and_explainability/fairness_and_explainability.html) â€“ Use SageMaker Clarify to create a processing job for detecting bias and explaining model predictions with feature attributions\. You can also see [an example notebook to read a dataset in JSON Lines format](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-clarify/fairness_and_explainability/fairness_and_explainability_jsonlines_format.html)\.
+ Additional example notebooks using Clarify include the following
  + [Bringing your own container](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-clarify/fairness_and_explainability/fairness_and_explainability_byoc.html)
  + [Running processing jobs with Spark](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-clarify/fairness_and_explainability/fairness_and_explainability_spark.html)
  + [Partial dependence plots \(PDPs\)](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-clarify/fairness_and_explainability/explainability_with_pdp.html)
  + Natural language processing \(NLP\) explainability with [text sentiment analysis](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-clarify/text_explainability/text_explainability.html)
  + Computer vision \(CV\) explainability with [image classification](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-clarify/computer_vision/image_classification/explainability_image_classification.html) and [object detection](https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-clarify/computer_vision/object_detection/object_detection_clarify.html)

These notebooks have been verified to run in Amazon SageMaker Studio\. If you need instructions on how to open a notebook in Studio, see [Create or Open an Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebook](notebooks-create-open.md)\. If you're prompted to choose a kernel, choose **Python 3 \(Data Science\)**\.
