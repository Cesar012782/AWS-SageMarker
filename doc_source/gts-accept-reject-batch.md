Accepting a batch informs your AWS expert to continue or complete the project, based on the number of remaining images you contracted\.

When you reject a batch, an AWS expert contacts you to determine the rework process and the next steps for the batch\.

Accepting or rejecting a batch is a one\-time action and can only be undone by contacting your AWS expert\. It is necessary to either accept or reject every batch of the project\.
