# Use model cards through the Amazon SageMaker console<a name="model-cards-console"></a>

You can create an Amazon SageMaker Model Card directly through the SageMaker console\. 

## Create a model card<a name="model-cards-console-create"></a>

Go to the Amazon SageMaker console\. In the navigation pane, under **Governance**, choose **Model cards**\. On the upper right\-hand corner, choose **Create model card**\.

Go through the four steps in the **Create model card** prompt to document details about your model\.

### Step 1: Enter model details and intended use<a name="model-cards-console-create-enter-model-details"></a>

If your model is an AWS resource, specify the exact model name in this field to auto\-populate model details\. To browse existing model names, see **Models** in the Amazon SageMaker console\. Each unique model name can have only one associated model card\.

If your model is not an AWS resource, provide a unique name for your model\. To add a model as an AWS resource, see [Create a model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/realtime-endpoints-deployment.html#realtime-endpoints-deployment-create-model) in the *Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide*\. Alternatively, you can add your model as a model package using [SageMaker Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-marketplace.html) or [SageMaker Model Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry.html)\.

For more information on intended uses, see [Intended uses of a model](model-cards.md#model-cards-intended-uses)\. For more information on risk ratings, see [Risk ratings](model-cards.md#model-cards-risk-rating)\. 

### Step 2: Enter training details<a name="model-cards-console-create-enter-training-details"></a>

Add any training details, training observations, datasets, hyperparameters, and details about the model's objective function to the model card\.

The objective function in a model card can be any function that is optimized during training\. This can include, but is not limited to, cost functions, loss functions, or objective metrics\. In this section, document the objective function that is most critical to training your model\.

We recommend that you catalog the following attributes of your objective function:
+ Optimization direction
+ Metric
+ Description

For example, you might minimize \(optimization direction\) cross entropy loss \(metric\) for a binary classification problem \(description\) or maximize likelihood for logistic regression\. Additionally, you can provide notes about why you chose this objective function over others\. 

### Step 3: Enter evaluation details<a name="model-cards-console-create-enter-evaluation-details"></a>

If you have existing evaluation reports generated by SageMaker Clarify or Model Monitor, either provide an S3 URI for those reports or upload them manually to add them to the model card\. 

For more information on Clarify, see [Run SageMaker Clarify Processing Jobs for Bias Analysis and Explainability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-processing-job-run.html)\. 

For more information on monitoring drift in model quality metrics using Model Monitor, see [Monitor model quality](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor-model-quality.html)\. 

To add your own evaluation report, choose **Generic model card evaluation**\. All model card evaluation reports must be in the [Model card JSON schema](model-cards.md#model-cards-json-schema)\.

### Step 4: Enter additional details<a name="model-cards-console-create-enter-additional-details"></a>

Add custom model card detail fields for any additional information that you want to address on your model card\. For example, you might include the custom field *Line of business* with a value of *Personal finance*\.

### Save model card<a name="model-cards-console-create-save"></a>

After reviewing the information in your model card, choose **Save** in the lower right\-hand corner to save your model card\.

## Edit a model card<a name="model-cards-console-edit"></a>

To edit a model card, navigate to the model card of your choice by selecting its name in the Amazon SageMaker Model Card console and choose **Edit**\. 

After you save a model card, you cannot edit the name of that model card\. After you save a model card version, you cannot update that version of the model card\. Any edits that you need to make are saved as a subsequent version in order to have an immutable record of model changes\. 

To view different versions of the model card, choose **Actions**, **Select version**, and then choose the version that you want to view\.

## Export a model card<a name="model-cards-console-export"></a>

Follow these steps to export a model card\.

1. Go to the Amazon SageMaker Model Card console\.

1. Choose the name of the model card you want to export\.

1. In the model card overview, choose **Actions** and then **Export PDF**\.

1. Enter an S3 URI or browse available S3 buckets for your model card PDF\.

1. If your model card exports successfully, you can either choose **Download PDF** in the resulting banner or download your PDF directly from Amazon S3\. 

## Delete a model card<a name="model-cards-console-delete"></a>

Follow these steps to permanantly delete one or more model cards\.

1. Go to the Amazon SageMaker Model Cards console\.

1. Check the box to the left of the name of the card\(s\) you want to delete\.

1. Choose **Delete** in the upper right\-hand corner\.

1. Confirm your request to permanently delete one or more cards\.\.

You can also delete a model card when viewing the model card overview in the console by choosing **Actions** and then **Delete model card**\.
